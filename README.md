# PottyTime!

Getting a new puppy involves lots of getting up in the middle of the night. I wanted to track how long he was lasting between potty breaks, but I hated fiddling with my notes app when I was dead tired. I made this app so I could push one button, then go back later when I was awake and log the data. I'm not planning on making this a big thing. No integrations or anything. Just a watch app to track poop.

I guess this could also work for a baby or whatever.
